# scripts

This folder contains various scripts. Most are probably intended for use with an AutoHotKey shortcut (see [AutoHotKey.ahk](../AutoHotKey.ahk)), and also may not work on your computer. The requirements for the Python scripts are in `requirements.txt`. They can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
