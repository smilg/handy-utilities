# launchy stuff

This folder contains various things I use with the program Launchy, which can be found at [launchy.net](). To use the things in this folder, put a portable installation of Launchy in it. Don't replace `launchy.ini`, it contains the settings. I use the plugin Mathy Resurrected which can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mathyresurected/).

I have a few custom shortcuts and scripts I use with Launchy in the folders `Shortcuts` and `Scripts`. None of them are guaranteed to work without some tweaking.
